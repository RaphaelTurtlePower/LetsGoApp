LetsGoApp
=========

The Let's Go App was conceived of, and implemented over a couple of weeks 
in July 2014, by Christian Mamuad, Ashley Jiang, and Peter van der Linden.

Let's Go helps you find interesting local events, vote on their popularity, 
and connect it all to people in your social network (Facebook today, other 
networks straightforward to connect).

User stories:
	Find events (from EventBrite, and also crowdsourced)
	Create your own event descriptions (for other's events, and your own)
	Vote on events (like/don't like)
	Share event details to your calendar, email, and text
	Look at events on a map
	Look at events in a List.

Features:
	We made an effort to use modern Android features that were
approriate to the latest Android style guide.  Example: we used the
Android Action bar introduced with Android 3.0, not one of the older
backward compatible versions.

	The app supports searching within a radius of miles, and also
searching by type of event.  There are 11 predefined event types (e.g.
performing arts, community, party, food and drink).  You can see the 
whole list on the "Create New Event" screen.

Status:

	App works well, and showcases our Android Development work.
